## Pre-condition:

Two project files are created, each containing source code:
File 1 (Initial location for the new method)
File 2 (Target destination for the method)

## Steps to Reproduce:

1. Create a new method in File 1.
2. Perform the following actions:
3. Go to Refactor â†’ Move Members.
4. Select the newly created method.
5. Set File 2 as the destination.
6. Click Refactor.
7. Verify that the method is moved to File 2.
8. Use Undo to revert the changes.

## Expected Result:
The new method should be restored in File 1.

## Actual Result:
Bug 1 (Priority Medium):
A modal window with an error message appears during the Undo operation. The method remains in File 2 instead of being restored to File 1.
